Tree-Builder version 0.01
=========================

Tree::Builder is a package designed to take the grunt work out of
writing the numerous classes required to build Abstract Syntax Trees
from various grammars. It accepts an input file that defines the
container relationships between the nodes of the AST, and outputs
a set of classes, one per node, that can be later combined to build
an AST.

The generated node classes all contain an accept() method supporting
the Visitor Pattern, and a default Visitor class is also generated,
so that it can be subclassed.

Additionally an API package is produced to make the construction
of the AST as simple as possible.

Although initially designed to produce Perl classes, it has been
extended to produce output in both C++ and PHP, and other languages
could hopefully be added fairly trivially.
